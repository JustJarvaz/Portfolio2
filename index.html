                    <p>I developed an interest in web and app development during the quarantine.
	 I saw this meme one day that was like: "If you didn't learn a new skill during the quarantine then,
	 you wasted your time."
	 That pushed me from then on to learn something new. Which led me to Thinkful, a coding boot camp that I felt stood out from the few that had interested me. Now starting wasn't easy at all.
	 I had to completely rewire my brain, from the way my thought process worked to the habits I had
	 developed over my whole life.
	 But I was willing to grow beyond my comfort zone and learn new things. I was mostly excited to
	 be in a new environment and build a team of dedicated developers like me.
	 Before learning to code, I was an aspiring Musician/Songwriter from "The Live Music Capital Of
	 The World!" aka Austin, Texas. Because of that,
	 My networking skills are superb.
	 I WILL GET YOUR INFORMATION! DON'T FIGHT IT!
	 It also means I have that creative spark one will need in this field. It allows me to think
	 outside the box, the gift wrap, AND the store from which it came.
                    </p>

                    <p> I have experience working with: React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js,
                        Unit Testing, JSON, RESTful APIs, Git/GitHub, Command-Line, and npm.
                        I am eager to begin working with a solid team of like-minded developers.</p>
